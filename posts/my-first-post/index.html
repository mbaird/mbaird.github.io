  <p>Perhaps an attic shall I seek. Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit.
Sister&rsquo;s my new mother, Mother. And is it just me or is she looking hotter?</p>
<p>One of the guys <code>told me to take</code> my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my
BOTTOM! He&rsquo;s going to be all right. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. I&rsquo;m an
ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with &ldquo;Fuck Mountain.&rdquo; Actually, that
was a box of Oscar&rsquo;s legally <a href="google.com">obtained medical marijuana</a>. Primo
bud. Real sticky weed. Speaking of settling<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, How&rsquo;s Ann? Although George
Michael had only got to second base, he&rsquo;d gone in head first, like Pete Rose.</p>
<h2 id="testing-a-second-heading">Testing a second heading</h2>
<p>There are dozens of us! Dozens! No, Pop-pop does not get a treat.</p>
<p>And the soup of the day is bread. What have we always said is the most important
thing? I may have committed some light treason. I think that&rsquo;s one of Mom&rsquo;s
little fibs, you know, like I&rsquo;ll sacrifice anything for my children. No, Pop-pop
does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. A night of
heterosexual intercourse.</p>
<h3 id="i-just-bought-you-a-fking-pizza">I just bought you a f**king pizza.</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a jetpack, Michael. What could go wrong? What do you think about Sudden
Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don&rsquo;t want to eat
it. Way to plant, Ann!</p>

<p>I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she&rsquo;s shaped like a…she&rsquo;s the belle of
the ball! [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I&rsquo;m going to run this through again on &ldquo;pots
and pans.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t criticize you! And if you&rsquo;re worried about criticism,
sometimes a diet is the best defense. She tried pesto for the first time.
Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto. Oh…yeah…the guy in the…the
$4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn&rsquo;t make that in three
months. Come on! It looks like you&rsquo;ve been looking for dragons… in the future.
Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I&rsquo;ve ever taken! ps This one
really cracks me up for some reason.</p>
