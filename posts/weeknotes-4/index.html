<p>Opting for a slightly different take on the traditional burns night supper, we picked up an assemble-at-home kit of <a href="https://restaurantkitsuk.com/#/restaurant-kit-detail?kitId=5feddd896fcae86555095c29">haggis tacos from Mac &amp; Wild</a>. Recollections of Buckfast-fuelled teenage house parties made me apprehensive about &lsquo;Buckfast sriracha hot sauce&rsquo;. Still, it turned out to be fantastic and not at all reminiscent of the strong-smelling, tar-like substance prevalent in my youth.</p>
<p>The kit included a QR code for an accompanying <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1NMNTcqutyUNHpDZ1cYWWu?si=vO2yzdRBQdyzZLHl9eZNjw">Spotify playlist</a>, mostly featuring the Peatbog Faeries and the Red Hot Chilli Pipers which a friend was quick to brand as &lsquo;tourist pish&rsquo;. We opted for Skipinnish and some Andy Stewart instead, which made me terribly homesick<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>My autumn lockdown purchase of espresso machine and grinder has proved invaluable these past few weeks as one of the most miserable months in recollection comes to an end. A few folks have asked me about what to buy or where to find information, so here goes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mostly avoid the subreddits <a href="http://reddit.com/r/espresso">/r/espresso</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/r/coffee">/r/coffee</a>. The majority of the content seems to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/hvl5nf/my_happy_place/">high-quality photos of expensive setups costing £2k+</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/iq3j6j/bottomless_extraction_on_my_rocket_giotto/">slow-motion videos of shots pulled on &lsquo;naked&rsquo; portafilters</a>. I&rsquo;ve found these subreddits to be pretty low quality compared to other hobbyist communities, specifically when you&rsquo;re a beginner and don&rsquo;t have a multi-thousand-pound budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch reviews of equipment by <a href="https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk">James Hoffman</a> (who incidentally co-founded Square Mile Coffee, the suppliers of my favourite coffee shop in London, <a href="https://prufrockcoffee.com">Prufrock Coffee</a>). His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ">YouTube channel</a> is excellent, specifically his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HIGdYy5of4">review of machines under £500</a> and series on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxz0FjZMVOl3ksLTyWsWNFdU1b73w1BUW">how to dial in espresso</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be clear about what you want. Are you merely looking for good espresso at home, a new hobby, or maybe a bit of both? Whilst the ritualistic process of using a <a href="https://www.rok.coffee/uk/grindergc">manual grinder</a> might sound appealing on a lazy Sunday morning, trying to squeeze in a quick flat white before a Zoom call might not be possible, especially if you need to dial in a new bag of beans.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying playing <a href="https://grounded.obsidian.net">Grounded</a> with friends this week, as one of the few titles on Game Pass with decent online co-op features and crossplay with Windows. It&rsquo;s a survival game that feels like a cross between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug%27s_Life">A Bug&rsquo;s Life</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey,_I_Shrunk_the_Kids">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a> with a resource and crafting element. Highlights include bashing an ant to death with a spikey sprig of grass crafted from thistle needles and rope to find materials to make an &lsquo;ant helmet&rsquo; armour piece &mdash; lots of fun.</p>

<p>It is my belief that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/37aktFEvVXrSx4c7Spv7xl?si=wXJY2-XFQZeBPt5o59KQWQ">scottish-types covering chart bangers</a> produce some of the best music known to man. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
