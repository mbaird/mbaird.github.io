      <description>I have joined Signal, as have a healthy majority of frequent contacts.
  This week I endured my first engagement with Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Feedback Assistant&amp;rsquo;, the bug reporting tool shipped with macOS. Coincidentally, just this week I&amp;rsquo;d listened to ATP #411: Are My Instructions Not Clear?, where the hosts debate the numerous fundamental issues with the process at length. It did not fill me with hope.
The bug in question causes my system to intermittently hang for 1 - 2 seconds when typing into the Safari address bar.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been keen to try writing weeknotes for a couple of reasons: mostly as a way to improve my written communication, but I also think I&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy a regular nudge to reflect on each week as they happen.
  Slack weren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones with website problems this week after a late-evening SMS told me our website at work was completely down. Initial inspection showed that our tiny Heroku set up of just 2 small dynos had been overwhelmed by traffic.</description>
