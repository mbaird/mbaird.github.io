<p>The pain in my wrists is frustratingly persistent. I need to constantly remind myself not to &lsquo;over exercise&rsquo; as I usually do when it flares up, causing more problems. Instead, I&rsquo;ve taken some time off work and tried to minimize time using keyboards, mice and controllers (which means no <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>), but now I don&rsquo;t know what to do with myself.</p>

<p>Walking around the streets in 17-degree sunshine this week provided a little taste of spring, reminding me just how enjoyable London can be when it&rsquo;s not dark, cold and raining. What a difference a week makes.</p>

<p>Bojo&rsquo;s adamant focus on &lsquo;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56095552">data not dates</a>&rsquo; before predictably reeling off a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52530518">list of dates</a> at which we can begin to &lsquo;restart our lives&rsquo; prompted some reflection on what the hell that means and whether it could (or should) feel remotely the same after the end of June.</p>
<p>So many of my friends have either left London or are in the process of leaving. Those who left early with a view to it being temporary aren&rsquo;t so sure any more. Like many companies, it&rsquo;s unlikely we&rsquo;ll return to anything like the old office-centric ways of working. The uncertainty and unpredictability are draining.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been subscribed to Will Larson&rsquo;s blog, <a href="https://lethain.com/">Irrational Exuberance</a>, for a few years now. His writing style doesn&rsquo;t always appeal to me; I find it often vague and high-level, like early drafts of ideas that aren&rsquo;t quite formed or refined enough to really hit home. That said, <a href="https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/">An Elegant Puzzle</a> has some excellent advice on engineering strategy and management that I&rsquo;ve read multiple times and highly recommend.</p>
<p>Last year, Will started a separate blog called <a href="https://staffeng.com">StaffEng</a>, focusing on individual-contributor and leadership content for &lsquo;<a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/overview-overview">staff plus</a>&rsquo; engineers. I&rsquo;ve found it provides a rare depth of insight into technical roles beyond simply &lsquo;senior&rsquo; where most people seem to be focused. Recently it was <a href="https://staffeng.com/book">released in book form</a>, which I&rsquo;ve been thoroughly enjoying and finding much more actionable than the more manager-focused content of <a href="https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/">An Elegant Puzzle</a>.</p>
