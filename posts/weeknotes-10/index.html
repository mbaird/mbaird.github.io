<p>In an attempt to slightly upset the monotony of working from home during a national lockdown, I took this week as annual leave. Taking leave without any plan for how I&rsquo;ll spend the time isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;m used to, but I look forward to turning off Slack and work email all the same. Maybe I&rsquo;ll finally have the energy to see what my nearly-expired trial of <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple Fitness+</a> has to offer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In search of gifts to send home for Mothers Day, I bought myself some <a href="https://store.dishoom.com/permit-room-collection">Permit Room Collection</a> cocktails and highly praised <a href="https://store.dishoom.com/bacon-naan-roll-kit">Bacon Naan Roll Kit</a> from Dishoom. I&rsquo;m keen to try their <a href="https://www.dishoom.com/cookery-book/">Permit Room Old Fashioned</a> before attempting to make it from the recipe, which recommends ageing the green tea and brown sugar reduction for somewhere between a month and two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We bought some new laptops for employees at work, opting to switch to Apple Silicon for the first time. It made financial sense to switch, but if I&rsquo;m honest, I was keen to investigate the performance gains for everyday tasks like running the test suite for our Rails monolith. I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed, with early tests providing a 50% reduction in test times compared to a mid-spec 2018 MacBook Pro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking advantage of new lockdown rules, I caught up with a friend over some drinks in Hyde Park. This somewhat compromised my ability to write clearly the next morning, so these notes are a few days late. As lockdown eases, I may be required to revise the Sunday morning writing schedule.</p>
