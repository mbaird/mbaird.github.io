      <description>The lack of genuine next-gen titles for the Series X has kept me playing Apex Legends (albeit now at an impressive 4K 60fps), bringing my total time spent playing over the last two years to just over 500 hours. I put that down to the terrific job Respawn do of making the game feel fresh and new with regular season updates without ruining the core of the game. Thankfully 10,000 hours is a myth, so I might be well on my way to mastery.</description>

      <description>I have joined Signal, as have a healthy majority of frequent contacts.
  This week I endured my first engagement with Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Feedback Assistant&amp;rsquo;, the bug reporting tool shipped with macOS. Coincidentally, just this week I&amp;rsquo;d listened to ATP #411: Are My Instructions Not Clear?, where the hosts debate the numerous fundamental issues with the process at length. It did not fill me with hope.
The bug in question causes my system to intermittently hang for 1 - 2 seconds when typing into the Safari address bar.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been keen to try writing weeknotes for a couple of reasons: mostly as a way to improve my written communication, but I also think I&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy a regular nudge to reflect on each week as they happen.
  Slack weren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones with website problems this week after a late-evening SMS told me our website at work was completely down. Initial inspection showed that our tiny Heroku set up of just 2 small dynos had been overwhelmed by traffic.</description>
